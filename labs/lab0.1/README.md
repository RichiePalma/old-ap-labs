## The C Programming Language - Exercise 1.23

Write a program entab that replaces strings of blanks by the minimum number of tabs and blanks to achieve the same spacing. Use the 
same tab stops as for detab. When either a tab or a single blank would suffice to reach a tab stop, which should be given preference?

gcc exercise1-23.c

Then write text in console.

/* 'text'*/ other  - Only 'other' is printed... 'text' is ignored
